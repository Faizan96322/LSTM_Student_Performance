I have created an input css file using randint to create random values.
The code is shared in the file named random_val_gen_for_input_data.py
The csv files names is input_data

Now, for the first algorithm which is stored in output_data, I have calculated all the said variables in the question and appended the calculated results in a new file called output.csv

For the second algorithm I have applied a basic lstm with the dataset being output_data.csv. The training accuracy was 97.5 percent and the testing accuracy was 80 percentage.

The accuracies can further be increased by collecting more data. And training the model on more real time datasets.
